# Internal Competition Frontend SDK
### Here you can find a plug-and-play JavaScript SDK for rendering useful components in the front-end of your team's controller! Examples of components include but are not limited to:
- Checkboxes
- Buttons
- Joysticks
- Dials
- Sliders

### This SDK will allow you to render these elements with intuitive function calls. Furthermore, we have built-in code to help you extrapolate useful information for each of these components (ie. x, y positions for a joystick.) Make sure you are using an updated browser when rendering your front-end application.
